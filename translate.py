WITH the rapid development of aerospace, deep-sea exploration, and unmanned technologies, Internet of remote things (IoRT) devices have been widely adopted in remote areas (e.g., isolated islands, desert hinterlands, and the deep sea) for remote sensing and environmental monitoring [2]. These informative sensing data can be further utilized for artificial intelligence (AI) model training to support a large number of data-driven intelligent applications, like natural hazard analysis and vegetation extent monitoring [3]. However, with the absence of terrestrial communication facilities such as fifth-generation (5G) base stations in remote areas, it is challenging for the dispersed IoRT devices to transmit the collected data to a centralized server for further processing and training. The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) [4], serving as a complement and extension of terrestrial communication networks, offers seamless wireless access to wide geographical areas and provides a promising solution to facilitate IoRT data transmission. Specifically, SAGIN is based on a hierarchical network architecture that integrates satellite constellation in the space layer, air nodes (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, airships, balloons, etc.) in the air layer, and end devices (e.g., IoT devices) in the ground layer. The satellite constellation introduced in SAGIN is responsible for global coverage, while the air nodes flying at a low altitude can provide flexible ubiquitous accessibility with low propagation latency, thus supporting the data transmission of IoRT applications [5], [6]. Taking advantage of the wide coverage and large communication capacity of SAGIN, many established satellite operators are deploying their SAGIN projects (e.g., Starlink, Telesat, OneWeb, etc.) [4]. To reap the benefits of the massive data from the IoRT devices, a predominant approach is to collect the scattered IoRT data to a cloud server for centralized machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model training [7]. Nevertheless, this kind of approach requires a central server to continuously collect the massive volume of sensing data scattered around the IoRT devices over expensive satellite networks in SAGIN scenarios, which will lead to heavy communication costs and privacy concerns [8]. To cope with these problems, a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method termed Federated Learning (FL) is proposed [9].
